This program reads a sudoku puzzle from a file and generates clauses in the DIMACS format. To understand this problem, you may read http://sat.inesc.pt/~ines/publications/aimath06.pdf
It use the propositional variables Si,j,d for a Sudoku puzzle, which is true iff the digit in the cell at row i and column j is d, where i, j, and d are in { 1, 2, ..., 9 }. To encode this variable into an integer in the DIMACS format, it uses: code(i, j, d) = 100*i+10*j+d.

To see see that the CNF is correct use:
1) https://www.msoos.org/2013/09/minisat-in-your-browser/ (Note: this will not work for large N (ie. N=100) but it has useful output)
2) https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~gregory/sat/  (Can determine satisfiability of the CNF but does not give other output; needs "p cnf n*n" header)
3) http://minisat.se/ (Download MiniSAT and run on own computer)
